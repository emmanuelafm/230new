Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted us to design a web browser version of their Android-based game, Draw it or Lose It. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In this documentation, I think what I did particularly well was defining the highlights of each operating platform. There are so many factors to take in for each one, and knowing the best parts of each one is important in deciding what would be the most appropriate platforms to host the game on.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Understanding the security risks and how we could secure our code based on that knowledge was very helpful.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would pick the recommendations part to revise, because I do not think my knowledge was advanced enough on each platform to truly know which one to recommend to build on.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by reading and re-reading all of their requests, doing my own research, and finding compromises and writing them into my document. It is important to consider the user's needs in software development just as it is important to consider a customer's needs in a restaurant or store. If you are providing services to a customer, they expect to have some of their requests met as well as your own expertise applied into the product. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approach designing software with security as my top priority. Nowadays, hackers are rampant, and it is vital to have secure applications and websites more than ever before. Also, since our game is reliant on showing high-definition images, I had to ensure that memory management wouldn't be an issue for the average user.
